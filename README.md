## üìä Data Collection Process
1. **Initial Web Scraping Attempt:** Tried scraping Hobart's website but faced dynamic content issues (Sidearm Sports platform).
2. **PDF Data Extraction Attempt:** Attempted parsing PDF box scores but found inconsistent formatting challenges.
3. **NCAA Game Manager (XML Files):** Gained access to XML files for structured data ‚Äî but 18 games had missing/incomplete data.
4. **Database Schema and Table Setup:** Created PostgreSQL schema with `game_date` as the primary key.
5. **XML Upload Scripts:** Wrote Python scripts to upload XML files into PostgreSQL.
6. **PDF to JSON Conversion:** Built a PDF parsing script to convert data into JSON for consistent structure.
7. **JSON Upload to Database:** Uploaded converted JSONs into PostgreSQL.
8. **Data Export & Cleaning:** Exported database to CSV, cleaned datasets manually in Excel.
9. **Manual Data Entry:** Manually entered 8 missing games.
10. **Final Data Validation:** Used SQL `COUNT()` and manual checks to ensure integrity.

## üõ† Sample SQL Query
Here's a small example of one of the queries used to calculate team possessions:

```sql
SELECT 
    season,
    ROUND(AVG(avg_fga - avg_oreb + avg_to + 0.475 * avg_fta), 2) AS possessions
FROM team_stats
WHERE team_id = 'HOB'
GROUP BY season;
